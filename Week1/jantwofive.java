        greeting and welcome. Notice both of these variables contain the same phrase "Hello"
        which is 5 letters. 
        The method returns 0 if the string is equal to the other string. In this case, it is 
        so it returns 0. 
        Again, pay attention to the method invocation of compareTo from the String class,
        using the dot attached to the variable/object dictates a direct action.
